Datat√§hti (_Finnish Olympiad in Informatics_) is an annual programming contest for Finnish secondary school students.

There are two stages:

* Elimination Round (in September/October)
* Final Round (in January/February) 

The duration of the Elimination Round is two weeks, and the solutions to the problems are submitted to an online server. The best participants of the Elimination Round are invited to the Final Round, which consists of a single contest organized at a university.

The best participants of the contest are invited to university training camps, and after several training contests, the Finnish BOI and IOI teams are selected.
